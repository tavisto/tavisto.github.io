I think I have decided to move my website from my current hosting provider and build a full stack myself on a server that I manage. Not only do I want to do this t o consolidate my monthly bills, but I want to have a place to play with new technologies. 

I did set myself up on Tumblr, but I think that will be relegated to silly stuff. I feel that I should have a good web presence that is professional if I am to be credible as a web developer and system admin. I want it to be my personal business card online that I am proud of. 

With that in mind I am off to move some web hosting stuff.
