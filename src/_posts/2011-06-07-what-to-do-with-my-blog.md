I realized that I haven't poste here in quite some time and I need to figure out what to do with it. I think I am going to either host it somewhere really cheap or host it on a server that I maintain. I don't really know which way to go right now.
On the one hand, hosting it somewhere else means I don't have to deal with updates or security or anything.
The other side of that coin is that it's my job at work to keep on top of that, and therefore a little effort on my part will keep me better at my current and future jobs.

Looking around for hosting is tough, all the sites look exactly the same and all feel sleazy to me. The vps hosting sites like Linode and Slicehost look way more appealing to me but I don't know if I really need that much server power reserved for my tiny little blog and online business card.

I am not sure what I am going to do, but I think for sure I will try and cut down my hosting costs. It's silly to overpay each month for services I don't use at all.
