To follow up on my phone post I decided to switch to Verizon and get the Droid Incredible. Amazon had a killer deal on them and I ordered one, but had to wait about a month for it. Â It was worth the wait to get the phone and the hassle of switching networks. Verizon has been awesome. I have had no problems with slow data or dropped calles. The call quality is really good and even my family has commented that I sound better when I call them. So for anyone out there debating the new iPhone 4 vs the Droid Incredible, I think the droid is better. I will say I do kind of miss the iPod part of my iPhone a little bit and I think I might go buy a Nano for stuff like bike rides and snowboarding.

Anyway I really think I made the right choice on this one and will update more if I have issues.
