# How did I get into computers?

I started working with computers back in the 1990s when I was a kid. We had a Macintosh Performa 450 that I would play games on and eventually started to learn how to modify things in the resource fork to make things work the way I wanted. Ever since then I have been tinkering with computers and bending them to my will.

In high school I started a real computer science class and learned C for the first time. It was amazing, I actually started to understand the underlying structures that make it all possible. I got the "Most Improved" award that year, for going from not knowing anything to being the person that everyone asked for help. The prize for that was a CD set installer for Slackware 3.5. The same thing that ran the school systems. My teacher really encouraged me to learn more about it and dive deeper, he saw that I had a natural affinity for these types of things.

I installed it on my home computer, but was disappointed that I couldn't get the X GUI to work right away, and the command line was confusing. The only resource was the little inset that came with the CDs and the man pages. It took quite some back and forth to get it working, but I was able to do it. I couldn't really figure out what to do with so I went back to Windows where I could play games. However it did teach me a lot about how operating systems work and boot processes.

That was what got me started, and I still love the puzzle of getting computers to do what I want them to do.
