# [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
Obsidian is a general purpose not taking tool with a trick up it's sleeve. The trick is that it's simply markdown with infinite configurability using plugins. It has become very popular with the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method of note taking and knowledge management. The main idea being that you write down all your ideas in a simple way that you can search and reference later. It has some really great built in features that make it very useful even right out of the box with the default configurations. Things can be made as complex or as simple as you care to make them depending on your needs and desires.

## Vaults
The top level organization in Obsidian is called a vault. This is where all your notes and other files are stored. It's a directory on your filesystem that contains all the markdown files that you create and edit in Obsidian. You can have multiple vaults and switch between them easily. This is especially useful for keeping work and personal notes separate or for having a vault for a specific project.

There are many ways you can manage your vaults. Lets dive in to a few of them.

### Local
The simplest thing you can do is just start a vault in a folder. It's not shared anywhere and is only available on the machine you created it on. However the best part of the way the vaults are stored is that you can move them around and copy them to new places and everything still works the same.

### Git
For those non technology folks, [git](https://git-scm.com/) is primarily a source control tool. It was developed to manage the development of the Linux kernel and is now the dominant way to track software development. This means there are lots of tooling around it and very large platforms for managing repositories such as Github and Gitlab.

This could be a good choice if you want to keep change history and sync your notes using a private repository on your git platform of choice. It does have some drawbacks when it comes to the workflow and usability across platforms though. Specifically mobile clients do not handle this method of syncing very well. There is a plugin to help manage this
### Cloud Drives

- a cloud service like Dropbox, iCloud or Google Drive.
- a service like [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) to keep your notes in sync between machines.
