# My First Post

This is an introcution to my first post in a really long time. I'm excited to share my thoughts, configs and other productivity setups that have made my life more organized.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "This is an example of bash"
```

```markdown
# This is a markdown example
```

```lua
-- This is a lua example
vim.opt.termguicolors = true
vim.notify = require("notify")
```

Obsidian is a great tool for note taking and daily journaling. I've been using it for a while now and I'm really happy with the results. I've been able to keep track of my daily tasks, notes and other important information that I need to reference later.
